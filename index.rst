Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to the Nutanix Bootcamp! This workbook accompanies an instructor-led session that introduces Nutanix technologies and many common management tasks. Each chapter has a lesson and an exercise (called a “mission”) to give you hands-on practice. The instructor explains the missions and answers any additional questions that you may have. Each mission provides you with general steps to complete it. If you need more instruction, scroll down to the answers section of the particular mission to see the specific instructions. Some missions may be divided into tasks, and each task guides you through the steps to completion.

At the end of the bootcamp, attendees should understand the basic concepts and technologies that make up the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud stack and should be well prepared for a hosted or onsite proof-of-concept (POC) engagement.

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention, where the numerical suffix corresponds to the subnet for that cluster:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.21.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
...........

.. note::

  The *<Cluster Password>* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Credential
     - Username
     - Password
   * - Prism Element
     - admin
     - *<Cluster Password>*
   * - Prism Central
     - admin
     - *<Cluster Password>*
   * - Controller VM
     - nutanix
     - *<Cluster Password>*
   * - Prism Central VM
     - nutanix
     - *<Cluster Password>*

Each cluster has a dedicated domain controller VM, **DC**, responsible for providing AD services for the **NTNXLAB.local** domain. The domain is populated with the following Users and Groups:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Group
     - Username(s)
     - Password
